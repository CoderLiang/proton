Proton
======

A full virtual-reality shooter using the Myo armband and the Oculus Rift

Installing
=========
This software requires an Oculus Rift, Myo armband, and accompanying software in order to be played correctly.
Executable versions are available in the root directory, and can be run directly. Mac and Linux versions are untested. Source is available in the src/ directory; you will need Unity Pro to develop.

Playing
=========
When you first run the game, you will see a Health and Safety warning. After several seconds, you will be able to press Enter to make this warning dissapear.
Next, look at the wall of text that says "Proton." Hold your arm out horizontally straight at the wall, and make a fist to begin.
Now, simply look around, and make gestures with the Myo to shoot at enemies! Fist and Spread Fingers will shoot. Thumb+Pinky will deploy a flamethrower, which will exterminate
all enemies you point it at for 6 seconds, but has a cooldown.
